This project fine-tunes a GPT-2 model on a subset of the English Wikipedia dataset to generate encyclopedia-style text. The implementation includes data loading, preprocessing, model fine-tuning, perplexity evaluation, and text generation examples, demonstrating improved performance and style consistency compared to the pre-trained GPT-2 model. The fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved for future use.
